# Image-to-GIF Generator


## 🚀 Project Overview
The **Image-to-GIF Generator** is an AI-powered project that utilizes **NVIDIA’s StyleGAN3** to generate high-quality images and seamlessly convert them into animated GIFs. This project is designed to demonstrate the capabilities of **Deep Learning and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** in image synthesis and animation.

## 🛠️ Skills & Technologies Used
- **Deep Learning & GANs** – Image generation using StyleGAN3
- **Computer Vision** – Image processing and transformation
- **Python & PyTorch** – Core programming and AI framework
- **OpenCV & ImageIO** – Image and GIF handling
- **CUDA Acceleration** – Optimized performance with NVIDIA GPUs

## 🎯 Key Features
- High-resolution image generation using **StyleGAN3**
- Smooth GIF creation from generated images
- Fully customizable parameters for better control
- Optimized for **NVIDIA GPUs** for fast processing

## 📌 How It Works
1. **Generate Images** – Uses a pre-trained **StyleGAN3** model to generate high-quality images.
2. **Convert to GIF** – Processes and combines generated images into an animated GIF.
3. **Customization** – Users can tweak various parameters like seed values, truncation, and noise settings to control outputs.
